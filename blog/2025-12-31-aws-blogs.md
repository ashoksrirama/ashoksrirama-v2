### Monitoring network performance on Amazon EKS using AWS Managed Open-Source Services

This post explores how to monitor network performance for workloads running in Amazon EKS clusters using advanced network observability features. It demonstrates how to capture Kubernetes-enriched network performance metrics and export them to AWS Managed Open-Source services like Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus and Amazon Managed Grafana. The solution addresses the challenge of correlating network flows to specific pods, services, and namespaces, providing platform teams with real-time visibility into service communication, latency bottlenecks, and security policy violations across their EKS environments.

### Amazon EKS Pod Identity streamlines cross account access

This post announces a significant enhancement to Amazon EKS Pod Identity that simplifies cross-account access for Kubernetes applications. The new feature eliminates the need for complex configurations and application-level changes by allowing you to specify both source and target IAM roles during Pod Identity association creation. Using IAM role chaining behind the scenes, the feature automatically provides necessary cross-account temporary credentials to pods at runtime, enabling seamless access to AWS resources across accounts without any code modifications while maintaining support for IAM role session tags.

### Maximizing GPU Utilization using NVIDIA Run:ai in Amazon EKS

This post addresses the challenges of GPU resource optimization in AI/ML workloads running on Amazon EKS. It introduces NVIDIA Run:ai fractional GPU technology, which enables dynamic GPU resource allocation based on actual workload needs, supports priority-based sharing, and provides configurable time slices for compute resources. The solution helps overcome common issues like static allocation and resource competition, potentially improving GPU utilization from as low as 25% to over 75% while supporting all NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs and integrating seamlessly with existing Kubernetes workflows.
