### Amazon EKS enhances Kubernetes control plane observability

This post announces new enhancements to Amazon EKS that provide cluster administrators with visibility into Kubernetes control plane performance. Amazon EKS clusters now automatically display curated dashboards visualizing key control plane metrics within the EKS console, and a broader set of control plane metrics are available through Prometheus endpoints and Amazon CloudWatch. These metrics enable cluster administrators to quickly detect, troubleshoot, and remediate issues such as scheduling delays and job completion problems, with all metrics available at no extra charge for clusters running Kubernetes version 1.28 or higher.

### Enhancing Developer Productivity: Finch’s Support for Development Containers and the Finch Daemon

This post announces two major advancements in Finch, an open source command-line tool for building and running containers: support for Visual Studio Code Dev Containers and the launch of the Finch Daemon. With Finch v1.4.1 and later, developers can now use Finch with development containers on macOS, Linux, and Windows, providing repeatable and consistent development environments. The integration with VS Code Dev Containers extension allows developers to use containers as full-featured development environments directly within the VS Code editor, eliminating the need for Docker Desktop.

### Announcing Finch on Linux for Container Development

This post announces that Finch, AWS's open source command line developer tool, now supports Linux in addition to Windows and macOS. With this addition, Finch provides a consistent container development experience across all major operating systems, supporting core functionality including building, running, and publishing containers. On Linux, Finch can directly utilize kernel capabilities such as namespaces and cgroups without requiring an intermediary virtualization layer, and it's packaged as RPMs for Amazon Linux distributions with support for multi-platform image building through QEMU user-space emulation.

### Rippling’s journey migrating to the new VPC CNI Network Policy Engine

Rippling is a workforce management system that eliminates the friction of running a business, combining HR, IT, and Finance apps on a unified data platform. Rippling’s mission is to free up intelligent people to work on hard problems. In this blog, we discusses the challenges Rippling faced with their existing CNI plugin and the benefits of using Amazon VPC CNI Network Policy Engine. The blog also details the steps Rippling took to migrate their Amazon EKS cluster using a blue-green strategy.

### Amazon VPC CNI introduces Enhanced Subnet Discovery

Users modernizing their applications using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) on AWS often run into critical IPv4 address space exhaustion driven by scale. They want to maximize usage of the VPC CIDRs and subnets provisioned for the EKS pods without introducing additional operational complexity. We believe that use of IPv6 address space is the long-term solution for users to build scalable networking solutions. However, we also understand that Amazon EKS users may be constrained to IPv4 environments owing to dependencies on other networking components and applications’ support for IPv6. Therefore, Amazon EKS is introducing support for Enhanced Subnet Discovery for helping users streamline network configuration and scale IPv4 based clusters without adding operational complexity.

### How Perry Street Software Implemented Resilient Deployment Strategies with Amazon ECS

Perry Street Software (PSS) is home to SCRUFF and Jack’d, two of the world’s largest gay, bi, trans, and queer social dating apps on iOS and Android. They have a lean ops team that supports an active user base 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Due to the global nature of the dating app business, downtime is not an option. In this blog, we emphasize the importance of safe deployment strategies to rollout the changes effectively to the end users minimizing the application downtime. These strategies apply to both user facing applications and backend queue processing workers. We dive into how PSS simplified the code deployment process while maintaining their deployment workflow and not slowing down deployment times. PSS have better security controls in place that reduce access to running instances and have enabled themselves to containerize their production environment, which simplified the migration to more efficient and cost effective AWS Graviton instance types.
