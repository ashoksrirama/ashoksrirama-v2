# Welcome to My AWS Container Lab 🧪

Hey there! Welcome to my collection of AWS container tutorials and experiments. Think of this as my digital notebook where I document things that actually work (and occasionally, things that spectacularly don't).

## What You'll Find Here

This is where I share hands-on guides, best practices, and lessons learned from working with AWS container services. No marketing fluff, just real-world solutions.

### 🎯 Topics I Cover

- **Amazon EKS**: Kubernetes on AWS without the cluster management headaches
- **Amazon ECS**: Container orchestration for those who prefer simplicity
- **AWS Fargate**: Serverless containers (because who wants to manage servers anyway?)
- **Networking**: VPC CNI, Load Balancers, and all the fun networking bits
- **Observability**: Because "it's not working" isn't a useful metric
- **Security**: IAM roles, Pod Identity, and keeping the bad guys out

## 🚀 Getting Started

Pick a topic from the sidebar that interests you, or just start clicking around. Each guide is designed to be practical and actionable - you should be able to follow along and actually build something.

:::tip Pro Tip
Most of these tutorials assume you have:
- An AWS account (preferably not your production one 😅)
- Basic familiarity with containers and Kubernetes
- A sense of adventure and willingness to debug
