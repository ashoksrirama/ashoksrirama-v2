# About Me 👋

Hi! I'm Ashok Srirama, a Principal Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS. 

## What I Do

I help organizations navigate the exciting (and sometimes chaotic) world of containers, Kubernetes, and Generative AI on AWS. My day job involves:

- 🎯 Helping customers design and build scalable container platforms
- 📝 Writing blog posts and creating content to share what I've learned
- 🎤 Speaking at conferences and meetups (when I'm not behind a keyboard)

## 📚 Author

I recently co-authored **[Kubernetes for Generative AI Solutions](https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Generative-Solutions-designing-optimizing/dp/1836209932/)** with Sukirti Gupta. This comprehensive guide covers everything from designing and optimizing to deploying GenAI workloads on Kubernetes. 

The book is perfect for solutions architects, DevOps teams, GenAI developers, and anyone looking to master the complete GenAI project lifecycle on Kubernetes. It includes real-world examples, best practices, and hands-on implementations covering:

- Setting up Kubernetes clusters for GenAI workloads
- Model optimization and fine-tuning strategies
- Scaling, security, and cost optimization
- GPU resource management
- Observability and monitoring
- High availability and disaster recovery

## My Journey

I've been working with AWS and containers for several years now, and I've seen the ecosystem evolve from "Docker is cool" to "we're running thousands of microservices in production and need help."

The best part of my job? Learning from customers who are solving real problems in creative ways, then sharing those solutions with the broader community.

## Philosophy

> "The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts."

This quote reminds me to stay humble and keep learning. Technology changes fast, and what worked yesterday might not work tomorrow. The key is to understand the fundamentals and adapt.

## When I'm Not Working

- ☕ Drinking coffee (probably too much)
- 📚 Reading tech blogs and documentation
- ✍️ Writing books and blog posts
- 🎮 Occasionally pretending I have time for hobbies
- 🐛 Debugging things that shouldn't be broken but somehow are
